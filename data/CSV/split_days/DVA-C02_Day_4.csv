106981,A social media application uses the AWS SDK for JavaScript on the frontend to get user credentials from AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS). The application stores its assets in an Amazon S3 bucket. The application serves its content by using an Amazon CloudFront distribution with the origin set to the S3 bucket. The credentials for the role that the application assumes to make the SDK calls are stored in plaintext in a JSON file within the application code. The developer needs to implement a solution that will allow the application to get user credentials without having any credentials hardcoded in the application code. Which solution will meet these requirements?,Add a Lambda@Edge function to the distribution. Invoke the function on viewer request. Add permissions to the function's execution role to allow the function to access AWS STS. Move all SDK calls from the frontend into the function.,Add a CloudFront function to the distribution. Invoke the function on viewer request. Add permissions to the function's execution role to allow the function to access AWS STS. Move all SDK calls from the frontend into the function.,Add a Lambda@Edge function to the distribution. Invoke the function on viewer request. Move the credentials from the JSON file into the function. Move all SDK calls from the frontend into the function.,Add a CloudFront function to the distribution. Invoke the function on viewer request. Move the credentials from the JSON file into the function. Move all SDK calls from the frontend into the function.,,A,"CloudFront Functions cannot call AWS services like STS, but Lambda@Edge can. Moving SDK calls to Lambda@Edge removes exposed credentials from the frontend."
106984,"An ecommerce website uses an AWS Lambda function and an Amazon RDS for MySQL database for an order fulfillment service. The service needs to return order confirmation immediately. During a marketing campaign that caused an increase in the number of orders, the website's operations team noticed errors for “too many connections” from Amazon RDS.

106989,A software company is launching a multimedia application. The application will allow guest users to access sample content before the users decide if they want to create an account to gain full access. The company wants to implement an authentication process that can identify users who have already created an account. The company also needs to keep track of the number of guest users who eventually create an account. Which combination of steps will meet these requirements?

Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST effort?,Create a new Auto Scaling group and target group for the beta version of the application. Update the ALB routing rule with a condition that looks for a cookie named version that has a value of beta. Update the test system code to use this cookie to test the beta version of the application.,"Create a new ALB, Auto Scaling group, and target group for the beta version of the application. Configure an alternate Amazon Route 53 record for the new ALB endpoint.

Use Amazon CloudFront with Lambda@Edge to determine which specific request will go to the new ALB. Use the CloudFront endpoint to send the test system requests to test the beta version of the application.",Create a new Auto Scaling group and target group for the beta version of the application. Update the ALB routing rule with a condition that looks for a cookie named version that has a value of beta. Use Amazon CloudFront with Lambda@Edge to update the test system requests to add the required cookie when the requests go to the ALB.,,A,Using an ALB rule based on a version cookie with a separate target group for the beta environment allows selective routing for test systems without needing a new ALB or CloudFront. This satisfies the requirement most directly.
107037,"A team is developing an application that is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances. During testing, the team receives an error. The EC2 instances are unable to access an Amazon S3 bucket.

Run another script to loop on the Lambda functions to create an IAM resource-based policy that allows the lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl action from the QA IAM group's Amazon Resource Name (ARN).,,A,Lambda Function URLs requiring AWS_IAM auth must be paired with an IAM identity‑based policy granting lambda:InvokeFunctionUrl. Option A correctly implements this.
107051,A developer maintains a critical business application that uses Amazon DynamoDB as the primary data store. The DynamoDB table contains millions of documents and receives 30-60 requests each minute. The developer needs to perform processing in near-real time on the documents when they are added or updated in the DynamoDB table.

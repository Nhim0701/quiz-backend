107059,A company must deploy all its Amazon RDS DB instances by using AWS CloudFormation templates as part of AWS CodePipeline continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) automation. The primary password for the DB instance must be automatically generated as part of the deployment process. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?,Create an AWS Lambda-backed CloudFormation custom resource. Write Lambda code that generates a secure string. Return the value of the secure string as a data field of the custom resource response object. Use the CloudFormation Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function to get the value of the secure string. Use the value to create the DB instance.,Use the AWS CodeBuild action of CodePipeline to generate a secure string by using the following AWS CLI command: aws secretsmanager get-random-password. Pass the generated secure string as a CloudFormation parameter with the NoEcho attribute set to true. Use the parameter reference to create the DB instance.,Create an AWS Lambda-backed CloudFormation custom resource. Write Lambda code that generates a secure string. Return the value of the secure string as a data field of the custom resource response object. Use the CloudFormation Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function to get a value of the secure string. Create secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use the secretsmanager dynamic reference to use the value stored in the secret to create the DB instance.,Use the AWS::SecretsManager::Secret resource to generate a secure string. Store the secure string as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager.
